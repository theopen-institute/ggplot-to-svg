At present, this demo contains just four files:

- `ggplot-to-svg.R` a demonstration script showing how to convert graphics from R's ggplot package into interaction-ready SVG graphics
- `map-svg.js` a very sloppy illustration of some interactivity with d3.js
- `mapdata.rds` pre-aggregated data, intended for those without access to NLSS-2011 microdata
- `map.svg` the output of our R script
